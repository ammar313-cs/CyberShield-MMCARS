                <h3>What is CyberShield?</h3>
                <div class="about-description">
                    <p>
                        CyberShield is a next-generation security monitoring and response system designed to act as an
                        <strong>intelligent security layer</strong> for your network infrastructure. Think of it as a
                        sophisticated sensor system embedded in your data pipeline - like a water quality monitor in a
                        pipe that continuously scans flowing water for contaminants without interrupting the flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system intercepts network traffic data, feeds it through multiple layers of analysis including
                        <strong>machine learning anomaly detection</strong> and <strong>AI-powered threat classification</strong>,
                        and automatically responds to detected threats while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through unimpeded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike traditional security tools that rely on static rules and signatures, CyberShield uses
                        <strong>Isolation Forest algorithms</strong> to learn normal traffic patterns and identify deviations,
                        combined with <strong>Large Language Models (Claude AI)</strong> for intelligent threat analysis and
                        response planning. This hybrid approach enables detection of both known attack patterns and novel,
                        zero-day threats.

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <div class="about-description">
                    <p>
                        CyberShield operates as a <strong>transparent analysis pipeline</strong> that processes network
                        traffic in real-time. The system is designed around Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with
                        a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI components work together autonomously.

                            <h4>Traffic Ingestion</h4>
                            <p>
                                Network packets are captured and normalized into structured events containing source/destination
                                IPs, ports, protocols, packet sizes, and TCP flags. This data flows into the analysis pipeline
                                via REST API or direct network tap integration.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Traffic features are extracted and fed into trained Isolation Forest models that identify
                                statistical anomalies. The system calculates threat scores based on packet rates, protocol
                                distributions, port scanning patterns, and behavioral signatures.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Detected anomalies are analyzed by Claude AI which classifies attack types (DDoS, SYN Flood,
                                Port Scan, Brute Force, SQLi, XSS), assesses severity levels, and generates human-readable
                                threat summaries with confidence scores.

                            <p>
                                Based on threat classification, the system automatically generates and executes response
                                plans - rate limiting suspicious IPs, blocking malicious sources, dropping connections,
                                or escalating to human operators for critical threats.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                All events, detections, and responses are streamed to the dashboard via WebSocket connections,
                                providing live visibility into system health, active threats, and mitigation effectiveness
                                with detailed audit trails.

                            <p>
                                The system maintains state in Redis for high-performance caching and can be configured to
                                adapt its detection thresholds based on historical data, reducing false positives while
                                maintaining sensitivity to genuine threats.

                        CyberShield can be deployed as an <strong>inline security gateway</strong> or
                        <strong>out-of-band monitoring system</strong>. In inline mode, traffic passes through the
                        system before reaching your application servers, enabling active blocking. In out-of-band mode,
                        traffic is mirrored for analysis without impacting latency.

                        CyberShield uses a <strong>hierarchical multi-model architecture</strong> similar to modern
                        AI coding assistants. This approach optimizes for both accuracy and cost-effectiveness
                        by using the right model for each task.

                            The central coordinator uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for complex reasoning tasks:
                            threat correlation, severity assessment, and deciding when to escalate
                            to human operators versus auto-mitigate.

                        <p>
                            Fast threat classification using Claude Haiku. Identifies attack types,
                            calculates confidence scores, and determines indicators of compromise
                            in milliseconds.

                            and honeypot redirects. Verifies action effectiveness and reports results.

                            The system waits for human approval before executing mitigation,
                            preventing false positives from causing service disruption.
